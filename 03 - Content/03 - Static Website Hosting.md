### Buy domain on AWS using Route 53

This was a pretty easy task, and luckily and kind of funny... iamjoshgilman.com was available. I can now also have the most epic email address - Josh@IAmJoshGilman[.]com

###  Create a hosted zone and manage its DNS records

##### What is a hosted zone? 

A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com). A hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name.


Create S3 Buckets to host website pages;






Configure Route 53 to link the domain name to the website;






Create an SSL certificate for the website using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM);





Create CloudFront distributions to secure the website in HTTPS.
