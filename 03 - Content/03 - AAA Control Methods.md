AAA, when used in regard to cybersecurity, stands for ==Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability==. This is an important security principle that allows us to ensure that only allowed individuals are permitted access to IT resources to limit the impact of certain access-based cyber-attacks, such as account compromises.

### Authentication
- This involves using some form of verification to confirm that the identity is correct.
	- Something you know (Can be stolen or guessed)
		- Passwords
		- Pin Codes
		- Security Questions
	- Something you have (Can be stolen)
		- Public keys
		- Access cards
		- Physical keys
	- Something you are (authentication by the characteristic, Hardest to be stolen)
		- Biometrics

- To have strong authentication to ensure that only the right people can gain access to buildings and systems, we need a combination of at least 2, but preferably 3, of these controls. Someone can steal your keys(==something you have==), but if your house has an alarm system that requires a 6-digit PIN to disable(==something you know==), someone breaking into the house will trigger the alarm. This is known as ==multi-factor authentication== to access security

### Authorization
- Authorization is all about what the authenticated user ==is permitted to do==. Using the ==Principle of Least Privilege==, we always want to give individuals only the ==access they require to complete their job, and nothing more==. If we gave everyone unlimited access, if their account is compromised then the attacker is going to have all of that access too - by reducing items that employees can access, we also restrict the access an attacker or insider threat could gain and abuse.

### Accountability
- Accountability is the process of being able to ==identify what has happened== and when which can be ==used as evidence== during a security event or incident. Accountability helps to ==validate what happened==, by who, and in some cases can help to uncover if this was actually the individual or if someone else used this identity to conduct malicious actions.
