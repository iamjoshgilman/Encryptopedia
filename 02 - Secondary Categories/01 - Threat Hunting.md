# Networking

The network is the great equalizer
- You see everything, regardless of platform
- Desktop, servers, IIoT, etc all reviewed the same
#### <u>You can hide processes but not packets</u>

Malware is usually controlled
- Which makes targeting C2 extremely effective
- Identify compromise when C2 "calls home"
- Must be frequent enough to be useful

# Threat hunting process order

- Identify connection persistency
- Business need for connection?
	- Reputation check of external IP
- Abnormal protocol behavior
- Investigation of internal IP
- Disposition
	- No threat detected = add to safelist
	- Compromised = Trigger incident handling

### Don't cross "the passive/active line"

- All threat hunting activity should be undetectable to an adversary
- Passive in nature
	- Review packets
	-  Review SIEM logs
- If active techniques are required, we must trigger incident response first
	- Example: Isolating the suspect host
	- Example: Running commands on suspect host

# C2 Detection Techniques

### Where to Start

- Traffic to and from the Internet
	- Monitor internal interface of firewall
- Packet captures or Zeek data
- Analyze in large time blocks
	- More data = better fidelity
	- Minimum of 12 hours, 24 is ideal
- Analyze communications in pairs
	- Every outbound session passing the firewall
	- Ignore internal to internal (high false positive)

### Does targeting C2 have blind spots?

- Attackers motivated by gain
	- Information
	- Control of resources
- Sometimes "gain" does not require C2
	- Just looking to destroy the target
	- Equivalent to dropping a cyber bomb
	- We are talking nation state at this level
- NotPetya
	- Worm with no C2 designed to seek and destroy

# Start by checking persistency
- Focus on persistent connections
	- Internal system in constantly initiating connections with an outside "system"
	- Long connections
	- Beacons

Long connections
▷ You are looking for:
▷ Total time for each connection
○ Which ones have gone on the longest?
▷ Cumulative time for all pair connections
○ Total amount of time the pair has been in contact
▷ Can be useful to ignore ports or protocols
○ C2 can change channels
